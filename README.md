# Project Rheumaconnect
### Helping Rheumatic patients easily access information related to their conditions within the ease of their homes

The main goal of this project is to help Rheumatic patients get relevant information related to their conditions without visiting the hospital clinic everytime they need something by building a tri-lingual information hub maintained by specialist doctors.

The development of the project is run by the Software Engineering Student Community of SLIIT, mainly with the support of fellow volunteers.
